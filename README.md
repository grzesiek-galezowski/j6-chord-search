# j6-chord-search
A WPF app for Roland J-6 to take a series of chords and display all scales that have these chords (including transposed)

## Web Tools
Two web-based tools are available online at: https://grzesiek-galezowski.github.io/j6-chord-search/

1. **J-6 Chord Browser** - Browse and explore chords, find scales that contain specific chord progressions
2. **MIDI Chord Display** - Visualize MIDI input in real-time with a piano keyboard display

You can also find the web versions in the `web/` and `docs/` directories.
